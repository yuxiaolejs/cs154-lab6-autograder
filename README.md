# CS 154 Lab05 autograder v0.0.7
Yes, it is an autograder for CS154, lab6.

Notice: This script does not guarantee a 100% coverage, and it does not guarantee that your code is correct. It is only a tool to help you test your code. Please make sure you understand the test cases and the expected results. This script itself may contain bugs, and it may not be able to test all the edge cases. Please use it with caution.

**There might be bugs in this script (since I am not really confident in my own solution). Proceed with caution!!**

Requirement:
- Python
- pyrtl
  
## Acknowledgement:
This script is based on the lab3 autograder by myself, and @r0ckwav3 contributed to the test cases.

**Thanks a lot Peter!**

## Notice:
- In order to test your code properly, this script assumes that your `addi` and `sw` are working properly. If you are not sure, please test them first (Your pipeline will be flushed everytime the test instruction tries to write to memory, so no worries!).
- Please check version number of this script (will be displayed when running). If does not match this document, please update it!
- This server might not be available all the time. (It's not even a server, it's my desktop plus a FRP NAT proxy...)
<!-- - If you found any bugs, please feel free to use the issue tracker on github to report it or just post it on piazza under [this post](https://piazza.com/class/lr49arnlyiq1kg/post/45) as a follow up. -->
- If you want to help improve this script, please feel free to fork this repo and make a pull request, things happening on the server side is under the `server` directory.

## Ways to install:
1. Download `test.py` from this repo to the same directory as your ucsbcs154lab6_*.py
<!-- 2. Copy from csil: `/cs/student/tianleyu/public/test.py`
   1. You can run `cp /cs/student/tianleyu/public/test.py .` in your lab3 directory to get it -->

## How to use:
- Copy `test.py` from this repo to the same directory as your ucsbcs154lab6_*.py
- Confirm or change the test cases in `test.py`, `main`.
- Run `python3 test.py`

## Update:
- 02/11/2024: Changed to lab6 prediction test
- 02/11/2024: Changed to lab5 forwarding logic test
- 01/27/2024: Use server to compile test cases. No `spim` or `nodejs` required.
- 01/30/2024: Add negative numbers to test cases
- 01/30/2024: Add register file tests

<!-- ## Special thanks to:
- @r0ckwav3 - provided static test cases on piazza
- @r0ckwav3 - suggested to remove requests package to avoid missing dependency
- @r0ckwav3 - suggested to use register file to test -->

## Server deployment instruction:
**Note:** you don't need to read this part if you just want to use the script.

This following instructions are only test for ubuntu 22.04, but should work on any **linux** distro.
1. Install nodejs (with npm), I'm using v21, but any version should work.
2. Install `spim` - This is a tricky part, the usual spim installed by `apt` is not working, you need to download the source code and compile it yourself. Or, if you are using ubuntu/debian, you can just copy the `spim` binary from csil to your server.
3. Install Python3 (I think your server should come with it)
4. Install pyrtl (with pip) - run `pip3 install pyrtl`
5. Clone this repo
6. `cd server`
7. Install dependencies - run `npm install`
8. Run the server - run `node app.js` (please note that this will run the server in the foreground, it will stop when you close the terminal)
9. (Optional) Install pm2 - run `npm install pm2 -g` (pm2 is a process manager for nodejs, will allow you to run the server in the background)
10. (Optional) Run it as a service - run `pm2 start app.js --name lab06_autograder`
11. (Optional) Install `frp` - This is a NAT proxy, you can find it [here](https://github.com/fatedier/frp). This is only required if you want to expose your server to the internet and you don't have a public IP address.
12. (Optional) Configure `frp` - This is a little bit tricky, you need to configure it to forward port 13002 to your server's http port. Please refer to the `frp` documentation for more details
13. (Optional) Regularly update the server - run `git pull` in the `server` directory, then restart the server (if you are using pm2, run `pm2 restart lab06_autograder`)

It was long, but it's not that hard, right? Congratulations, you are contributing to the class now!
